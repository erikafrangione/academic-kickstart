summary: Presenting my senior undergraduate research project at OBD 2018
abstract: "Parasitic plants acquire most or all of their nutrients from a host organism, instead of
independently synthesizing these nutrients as is done by autotrophs. Cuscuta (otherwise known
as dodders) is a genus of ~200 species of parasitic plants in the family Convolvulaceae.
Cuscuta is comprised of four subgenera: Cuscuta, Monogynella, Grammica, and Pachystigma.
All members of Cucusta are parasites to some degree, ranging from hemi-parasitic to fully
parasitic, and lacking photosynthetic ability entirely. Prior studies of plastid genomes displayed
significant variations in content that may be related to this photosynthetic spectrum. The goal of
this project was to assemble and annotate the plastid genome of Cuscuta africana from the
subgenus Pachystigma. The genome was assembled using a sequence assembly pipeline
beginning from raw sequence data composed of 126 base pair long reads. This data was
trimmed after assigning a PHRED score threshold for quality testing, and then assembled into
contigs using de novo assembly. The contigs were examined and selected for plastid content
based on a variety of characteristics, and then concatenated into a circular sequence of DNA.
The assembled genome was then annotated by comparing it to a reference species to identify
genes and other marker features on the plastid. In the future, this study will allow for
comparisons to be done between the C. africana genome to the genomes of species within
Cuscuta, as well as other photosynthetic species, to search for differences and similarities that
might exist, and the biological impacts of these differences, if any."
