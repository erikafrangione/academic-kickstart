My name is Erika! Iâ€™m a recent M.Sc. graduate from the University of Toronto specializing in evolutionary genetics/genomics. My interest in cutting-edge biological research began as an undergraduate student working in a genomics-based laboratory where I studied the link between plant parasitism and gene loss in chloroplasts. In my graduate work, I started to specialize in developing pipelines for high throughput NGS data analysis, and gained experience performing WGS and RNA-seq workflows using bioinformatics and statistical tools. Working on these projects has helped me acquire a strong interest in coding, allowed me to volunteer in many science outreach programs, and strengthened my ability to teach university level science across a broad spectrum of biological subjects.
