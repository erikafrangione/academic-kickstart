My name is Erika! I recently defended my M.Sc. thesis focusing on Evolutionary Genetics/Genomics at the University of Toronto. I use a combination of bioinformatics, genomics, and statistical techniques in my research, specializing in sequencing pipelines for high throughput DNA/RNA sequence data analysis. I also have an excellent knowledge of cell and molecular biology protocols in the wet-lab.

Iâ€™m passionate about learning to code, volunteering in science outreach programs, and teaching the next generation of scientists.
