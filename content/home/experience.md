  * Independently designed a high throughput RNA-seq pipeline for comparative transcriptomics in plants within a Linux environment.
  * Performed RNA extractions of multiple plant species at a quality suitable for next-generation sequencing.
  * Pre-processed and cleaned reads using tools such as Bowtie2, Samtools, BUSCO, Trim Galore!, BBtools, BLAST, and personally written Python scripts.
  * Assembled, annotated, and refined comprehensive reference transcriptomes using packages from the Trinity suite.
  * Quantified transcript expression counts with RSEM and searched for differential gene expression between plant populations with EdgeR.
  * Generated and maintained large genomic datasets such as genomic assembly files, functional annotation information, and gene expression matrices. Regularly worked with common bioinformatics file formats including fastq, fasta, bam, sam, vcf, gff, gtf, nwk, and various BLAST output formats.
  * Conducted statistical analyses and data visualization/manipulation using packages in R and Python (e.g., Tidyverse, Bioconductor, Biopython).
  * Routinely prepared detailed summary and progress reports of research findings.
  * Supervised and mentored undergraduate students as they worked on independent bioinformatics research projects.
